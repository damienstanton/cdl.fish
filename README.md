# `cdl.fish` ðŸ¦‘

## What?

`cdl` is a `make`-like function (although much simpler) for automating the
execution of workspace-specific functions in your day-to-day life using the
`fish` shell.

## Why?

I love the ubiquity of GNU `make`, but not its syntax. `fish` is great because
it is very pleasant to write/read, most things are functions, and `fisher`
provides a simple way to treat external functions like this one as proper
software modules that can be installed, upgraded, and removed.

## How?

```fish
$ # TODO: demo
```
